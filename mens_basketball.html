        <div id="officiating-concerns" class="rule-section">
            <h2>Major Officiating Concerns</h2>
            
            <p>The NCAA Men's Basketball Rules Committee issued the following directives to the men's basketball officiating community for the 2023-24 season:</p>

            <h3>1. Post Play</h3>
            <p>Call the first displacement foul especially on back down plays. Discern between illegal and incidental contact. When a player dislodges an opponent from a legally established position, it is a foul.</p>

            <h3>2. Bench Decorum</h3>
            <p>Consistent enforcement of bench decorum, the coaching box and unsporting conduct rules for both players and bench personnel.</p>

            <h3>3. Coverage and Whistle Discipline</h3>
            <p>The consistent and proper implementation of the three-person mechanics system leads to trust and increased call accuracy as a crew. Call accuracy decreases when officials call plays outside their primary coverage area.</p>

            <h3>4. Traveling</h3>
            <p>Identify the pivot foot when a player gains control of the ball. When players are allowed to travel, they gain a distinct advantage over their defenders.</p>

            <h3>5. Clock Awareness</h3>
            <p>Observe the game clock and shot clock throughout each possession. Obtain the magic number from each position on every possession.</p>

            <h3>6. Freedom of Movement</h3>
            <p>Our game is one of movement, screening action and cutters. Be diligent in calling fouls that inhibit players' ability to move freely around the court with or without the basketball.</p>

            <h3>7. Enforce the Rules</h3>
            <p>Consistently apply the rules throughout the game.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="rule1" class="rule-section">
            <h2>Rule 1 — Court and Equipment</h2>
            
            <h3>The Playing Court—Dimensions</h3>
            <p>The playing court shall be a rectangular surface free from obstructions with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sidelines:</strong> 94 feet in length</li>
                <li><strong>End lines:</strong> 50 feet in length</li>
                <li>At least 3 feet (preferably 10 feet) of unobstructed space outside sidelines</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Three-Point Field-Goal Line</h3>
            <p>The three-point field-goal line shall be a distance of <span class="highlight">22 feet, 1¾ inches</span> from the center of the basket to the outside edge of the line and 21 feet, 7⅞ inches in the corners.</p>

            <h3>Restricted-Area Arc</h3>
            <p>The restricted-area arc is a solid single-colored 2-inch line formed by a semicircle measured from the center of the basket to the inside edge with a <span class="highlight">radius of 4 feet</span> and extending in a straight line to the front face of the backboard.</p>

            <h3>The Ball</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Color:</strong> Pantone Matching System (PMS) Orange 151, Red-Orange 173 or Brown 1535</li>
                <li><strong>Circumference:</strong> Maximum of 30 inches and minimum of 29½ inches</li>
                <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Not less than 20 ounces nor more than 22 ounces</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Uniforms</h3>
            <p><strong>Numbers:</strong> The following numbers are legal: <span class="new-rule">0-99</span>. Team rosters can include 0 or 00, but not both.</p>
            <p><strong>Religious Head Wear:</strong> Religious headwear is permitted provided it is securely fastened to the head and is subject to the approval of the referee.</p>

                <li>After a try, pass or deflection strikes the ring or flange and the offensive team retains possession in their frontcourt</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Reset to 30 seconds when:</strong></p>
            <ul>

            <h3>The Team</h3>

            <h3>Substitution</h3>
            <p>An entering player is a substitute who has been beckoned onto the playing court by an official. A substitute becomes a player when they legally enter the playing court.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>After a successful field goal in the last 59.9 seconds of the second half or any extra period before the clock has been properly started</li>

            <h3>Airborne Shooter</h3>
            <p>An airborne shooter is a player who has released the ball on a try for goal. An airborne shooter retains that status until that player has returned to the floor.</p>

            <h3>Flagrant 1 Personal Foul</h3>
            <p>A flagrant 1 personal foul is deemed <span class="highlight">excessive in nature</span> (unwarranted or too much) and/or unnecessary (avoidable, uncalled for or not required by the circumstances of the play), but is not based solely on the severity of the act.</p>
            <p><strong>Disqualification:</strong> A player who commits <span class="highlight">three Flagrant 1 fouls</span> in a game shall be disqualified.</p>

            <h3>Flagrant 2 Personal Foul</h3>
            <p>A flagrant 2 personal foul involves contact with an opponent that is not only excessive, but also <span class="highlight">severe (brutal, harsh, cruel) or extreme (dangerous, punishing)</span>, while the ball is live. Results in automatic ejection.</p>

            <h3>Guarding Position</h3>
            <p>To establish an initial legal guarding position on the player with the ball:</p>
            <ul>
