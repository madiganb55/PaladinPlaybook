Placement of the ball in the top 1/3 of the sticks at the widest point and\nwith the sticks in an upright position (i.e., in the actual draw position with the\ntop sidewall of each stick facing upward to the sky);\nb. Awareness of any advantage/disadvantage that may be in effect due to the\nplacement of the ball between the sticks;\nc. Issuance of a green card to players who persistently place their finger/thumb\non the throat, sidewall, pocket, or other part of the head of the stick; and\nd. Identification of any movement (except for head movement of the players)\nafter the official’s verbal command, “Ready.”\nThe committee also encourages officials not to delay putting their hands on the\ndrawers’ sticks because of team substitutions or other conduct following a goal\nand prior to the administration of a draw. As a reminder, once the official’s\nhands are on the drawers’ sticks, the draw is being set and no substitutions\nmay occur. The committee also asks teams to be efficient with any huddles,\nsubstitutions, etc. following a goal and prior to the administration of a draw.\nDelays during the time period following a goal and prior to the administration\nof the draw will be considered delay-of-game fouls and will result in a green\ncard. While not required, the committee suggests that officials provide a verbal\nwarning to a team before calling the general delay of game foul when a team’s\nconduct amounts to delays between a goal and the administration of the draw.\nPicks\nThe committee encourages to permit legal picks and call illegal picks\nconsistently. The committee also encourages coaches to teach their players the\ndifference between legal and illegal picks. As a reminder, for a pick to be legal,\nthe picker shall stay within their vertical plane with a stance not wider than\nshoulder width apart and shall not lean into the path of an opponent or extend\ntheir hips into that path even though their feet are stationary. The picker is not\nrequired to face any particular direction at any time. The picker must give their\nopponent a chance to stop or change direction.\n6\n\n[PAGE 12]",

Anyone who has received a red card shall\nbe prohibited from participating in the team’s next game.\nReleasable Penalty\nA green card or yellow card offense, unless the yellow card is issued for a violation\nof Rule 2 or the NCAA Stick Check Instructions, excluding pocket depth, will\nbe considered a releasable penalty. A player will be released from the penalty area\nonce the one-minute (green) or two-minute (yellow) penalty has been served, or\nif the opposing team scores a goal. If a player has received a second yellow card,\nthe carded player may not return to the game, but the carded player’s team may\nsubstitute another player after the penalty has been served.\nRelease\nThe ball leaves the shooter’s stick.\nRestraining Line\nThis is a solid line at each end of the field 27 meters (30 yards) up field from the\ngoal line that extends fully from one side of the field to the other side.\nRestricted Area\nAn imaginary rectangle consisting of a line parallel to the end line that connects\nthe dots, a line across the top of the goal circle, extending out to the width of\nthe dots, and then two lines that connect the two lengths of the rectangle, which\nrun parallel to the sidelines.\nScoring Play\nThis is a continuous effort by the attacking team to move the ball toward the\ngoal and to complete a shot on goal. The scoring play is complete when:\na. A shot is taken.\nb. The attacking team loses possession of the ball.\nc. The attacking team stops the continuous attempt to score, or the\nplayer with the ball is forced by the defense to lose forward\nmomentum.\nd. The attacking team fouls.\n\n[PAGE 87]\n82 RULE 7 / DEFINITION OF TERMS\nShot on Goal\nThis is a shot when either the stick and/or body of the player taking the shot\nare positioned above goal line extended, and as a result of the shot, the ball\nmakes contact with the goalposts, crossbar, or any part of the goalkeeper while\nthe goalkeeper is within the goal circle, or crosses the goal line. For purposes of\nthis definition, the goalkeeper’s stick is considered part of the goalkeeper’s body\nwhile the goalkeeper is within the goal circle.\nSlashing\nThis is the swinging of a stick at an opponent’s stick or body with deliberate\nviciousness or recklessness, whether or not the opponent’s stick or body is\nstruck.\nSlow Whistle\nThis is a held whistle, with flag raised, once the attack has entered the critical\nscoring area and is on a scoring play.\nSphere\nThis is an imaginary area of 18 centimeters (7\") (the average width of the head\nof a stick) surrounding a player’s head.\nStep\nThis is the act or movement of lifting and setting down one’s foot to a new\nposition in any direction.\nStick\nA stick consists of a head and a shaft. The head of a stick is composed of the\nthroat, the ball stop, the sidewall and the scoop.\nStop-Clock\nThis means that the clock stops after each goal unless there is a 10 or more goal\ndifferential and during sudden-victory overtime.\nSubsequent Foul\nThis is a foul that occurs after the initial foul has been called. For example, a\nplayer is awarded a free position because of a foul by the opponent but then\nbefore play starts the player or the player’s team commits another foul such as\ntaunting the opponent.\nSubstitution Area\nThis is the area in front of the scorer’s/timer’s table, centered at midfield, and\nsectioned off by two hash marks that are each 4.5 meters (5 yards) from the\ncenter line of the field.\nTeam Bench Area\nThis is the area from the end of the substitution area to the team’s restraining\nline, and behind the level of the scorer’s/timer’s table extended.\nToeing the Line\nThis refers to the placement of the foot up to, but not on, the center line.\n\n[PAGE 88]",

          "content": "Lightning Policy\nLightning is the most consistent and significant weather hazard that may\naffect intercollegiate athletics. Within the United States, the National Oceanic\nand Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimates that 40 fatalities and about\n10 times that many injuries occur from lightning strikes every year. NOAA\nestimates that as many as 62% of lightning strike fatalities occur during outdoor\norganized sport activities. While the probability of being struck by lightning is\nlow, the odds are significantly greater when a storm is in the area and proper\nsafety precautions are not followed.\nEducation and prevention are the keys to lightning safety. The references\nassociated with this guideline are an excellent educational resource. Prevention\nshould begin long before any intercollegiate athletics event or practice occurs by\nbeing proactive and having a lightning safety plan in place. The following steps\nare recommended to mitigate the lightning hazard:\n1 Develop a lightning safety plan for each outdoor venue. At a minimum,\nthat plan should include the following:\na. The use of lightning safety slogans to simplify and summarize essential\ninformation and knowledge. For example, the following slogan from\nthe National Lightning Safety Institute is an effective guide: “If you see\nit, flee it; if you can hear it, clear it.” This slogan reflects the fact that\nupon the first sound of thunder, lightning is likely within 8 to 10 miles\nand capable of striking your location. No punishment or retribution\nshould be applied to someone who chooses to evacuate if perceiving\nthat their life is in danger due to severe weather.\nb. Designation of a person to monitor threatening weather and to notify\nthe chain of command who can make the decision to remove a team,\ngame personnel, television crews and spectators from an athletics site\nor event. That person must have recognized and unchallengeable\nauthority to suspect activity.\nc. Planned instructions/announcements for participants and spectators,\ndesignation of warning and all clear signals, proper signage, and\ndesignation of safer places from the lightning hazard.\nd. Daily monitoring of local weather reports before any practice or event,\nand a reliable and accurate source of information about severe weather\nthat may form during scheduled intercollegiate athletics events or\npractices. Of special note should be National Weather Service-issued\nthunderstorm “watches” or “warnings,” and the warning signs of\ndeveloping thunderstorms in the area, such as high winds or darkening\nskies. A “watch” means conditions are favorable for severe weather to\ndevelop in an area; a “warning” means that severe weather has been\n94\n\n[PAGE 100]",

An NOAA weather radio is particularly helpful in providing\nthis information.\ne. Identification of, and a mechanism for ensuring access to, the closest\nsafer buildings, vehicles, and locations to the field or playing area, and\nan estimate of how long it takes to evacuate to that location for all\npersonnel at the event. A safer building or location is defined as:\n• Any fully enclosed building normally occupied or frequently used\nby people, with plumbing and/or electrical wiring that acts to\nelectrically ground the structure. Avoid using the shower, plumbing\nfacilities, and electrical appliances, and stay away from open\nwindows and doorways during a thunderstorm.\n• In the absence of a sturdy, frequently inhabited building, any\nvehicle with a hard metal roof (neither a convertible nor a golf\ncart) with the windows shut provides a measure of safety. The\nhard metal frame and roof, not the rubber tires, are what protects\noccupants by dissipating lightning current around the vehicle and\nnot through the occupants. It is important not to touch the metal\nframework of the vehicle. Some athletics events rent school buses\nas safer locations to place around open courses or fields.\n2. For large-scale events, continuous monitoring of the weather should\noccur from the time pre-event activities begin throughout the event.\n3. Venue-specific activity-suspension, venue evacuation, and activity-\nresumption plans:\na. Upon the first sound of thunder, lightning is likely within 8 to 10\nmiles and capable of striking your location. Please note that thunder\nmay be hard to hear if there is an athletics event going on, particularly\nin stadia with large crowds. Lightning can strike from blue sky and\nin the absence of rain. At least 10% of lightning occurs when there\nis no rainfall and when blue sky is often visible somewhere in the\nsky, especially with summer thunderstorms. Lightning can, and does,\nstrike 10 (or more) miles away from the rain shaft. Be aware of local\nweather patterns and review local weather forecasts prior to an outdoor\npractice or event.\nb. Ensure a safe and orderly evacuation from the venue with\nannouncements, signage, safety information in programs, and\nentrances that can also serve as mass exits. Planning should account\nfor the time it takes to move a team and crowd to their designated\nsafer locations. Individuals should not be allowed to enter the outdoor\nvenue and should be directed to the safer location.\nc. Avoid using landline telephones except in emergency situations.\nPeople have been killed while using a landline telephone during a\nthunderstorm. Cellular or cordless phones are safe alternatives to a\nlandline phone, particularly if the person and the antenna are located\nwithin a safer structure or location, and if all other precautions are\nfollowed.\n\n[PAGE 101]\n96 APPENDIx C / LIGHTNING POLICY\nd. To resume athletics activities, lightning safety experts recommend\nwaiting 30 minutes after both the last sound of thunder and last flash\nof lightning. A useful slogan is “half an hour since thunder roars,\nnow it’s safe to go outdoors.” At night, be aware that lightning can be\nvisible at a much greater distance than during the day as clouds are\nbeing lit from the inside by lightning. This greater distance may mean\nthat the lightning is no longer a significant threat. At night, use both\nthe sound of thunder and seeing the lightning channel itself to decide\non resetting the 30-minute “return-to-play” clock before resuming\noutdoor athletics activities.\n4. Emergency care protocols: People who have been struck by lightning do\nnot carry an electrical charge. Therefore, cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n(CPR) is safe for the responder. If possible, an injured person should be\nmoved to a safer location before starting CPR. Lightning-strike victims\nwho show signs of cardiac or respiratory arrest need prompt emergency\nhelp. If you are in a 911 community, call for help. Prompt, aggressive\nCPR has been highly effective for the survival of victims of lightning\nstrike. Automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) are a safe and effective\nmeans of reviving persons in cardiac arrest. Planned access to early\ndefibrillation should be part of your emergency plan. However, CPR\nshould never be delayed while searching for an AED.\nNOTE: Weather watchers, real-time weather forecasts and commercial weather-\nwarning and lightning monitoring devices or services are all tools that can be\nused to aid in the monitoring, notification, and decision-making regarding\nstoppage of play, evacuation and return to play.\nDANGEROUS LOCATIONS\nOutside locations increase the risk of being struck by lightning when\nthunderstorms are in the area. Typically, anything referred to as a “shelter” is\nnot safe from lightning. Dugouts, refreshment stands, open press boxes, rain\nshelters, golf shelters and picnic shelters, even if they are properly grounded for\nstructural safety, are unsafe and may actually increase the risk of lightning injury.\nOther dangerous locations include high ground, bodies of water (pools, ponds,\nlakes) and areas connected to, or near, light poles, towers and fences that can\ncarry a nearby strike to people.\nREFERENCES\n1.

          "content": "Blood Guidelines\nOutlined below is the official USA Lacrosse policy regarding the handling of blood/\nbleeding situations during games. This policy is specific to women’s lacrosse and\nshould be followed by all teams in addition to guidelines developed by their schools.\nWhen a player suffers a laceration or wound in which oozing or bleeding\noccurs, the game should be stopped at the earliest practical time, and the player\nshould be given appropriate medical treatment. The player may return to the\ngame with the approval of medical personnel (team doctor, trainer or other\ndesignated person with medical training). The player may re-enter the game in\nthe same quarter, overtime half or period.\nIf the official stops the game because a player is discovered to be bleeding, the\nplayer must leave the game, and a substitute must enter. If the official stops the\ngame because an injury has occurred, the regular injury timeout procedure is\nfollowed. If an injury timeout has been called and it is then determined that it is\na bleeding problem, the player must leave the game, even if medical personnel/\ncoach have not come onto the field, and a substitute must enter.\nIn cases in which a goalkeeper is discovered to be bleeding and is the only\ndressed goalkeeper for the team, the game should be stopped at the earliest\npractical time. The goalkeeper should be given appropriate medical treatment,\nand then may remain in the game.\nIf there is blood on any part of a player’s uniform/personal equipment,\nmedical personnel should determine if the blood has saturated the uniform/\nequipment enough to require a change. In the absence of medical personnel, the\nofficial(s) will make this determination. A uniform is considered saturated when\nblood has soaked through the uniform to the player’s skin or is capable of being\ntransferred to another player. The same saturation criteria should be applied to\na player’s personal equipment (stick, gloves, knee brace, etc.).

They must\nsit or kneel.\nCoaches must remain outside the penalty area. If a carded player needs medical\nattention, medical staff may enter the penalty area to check on or treat the\nplayer. After notifying the scorer’s/timer’s table personnel, medical staff may also\nmove the player to the team bench area to continue treatment.\nGreen Cards: All players serving a releasable one-minute penalty for a green\ncard in the penalty area will be released when the opposing team scores,\nregardless of whether the green cards were issued at the same time/during the\nsame stoppage of play or at different times of the game. All players serving\na releasable one-minute penalty for a green card in the penalty area will be\nreleased when the opposing team scores even if teammates are serving a yellow\nand/or red card in the penalty area.\nGreen Cards and Yellow Cards: The release of a yellow card is not affected\nby whether the same team also has a player(s) serving a green card penalty in\nthe penalty area.\nTwo releasable yellow cards, one to each team: If a player from each\nteam receives a yellow card at the same time/during the same stoppage of play,\nany release will depend on which team scores a goal. Only the player from the\nteam that has not scored will be released should a goal be scored during the\npenalty time. Note, however, if one of the yellow cards issued is a team’s fourth\nor subsequent yellow card, the player issued the team’s fourth or subsequent\nyellow card must serve the entire two-minute penalty.\nTwo players from same team, each with a releasable yellow card: If\ntwo players from the same team each receive a yellow card at the same time/\nduring the same stoppage of play, they will serve concurrent penalties. They\nwill be released together should the other team score a goal before the end of\nthe two-minute penalty. Note, however, if one of the yellow cards issued is a\nteam’s fourth or subsequent yellow card, the player issued the team’s fourth or\nsubsequent yellow card must serve the entire two-minute penalty.\n99\n\n[PAGE 105]\n100 APPENDIx E / CARDING PROCEDURES\nTwo players from same team, each with a releasable yellow card at\ndifferent times: If two players from the same team each receive a yellow\ncard at different times, they will be released in order of their entry into the\npenalty area. If the opposing team scores before the penalty time has elapsed\nfor the player who entered the penalty area first, that player will be released.\nThe player’s teammate who entered the penalty area second will not be released\nuntil that player’s penalty time has elapsed or the opposing team scores a\nsecond goal. If before the opposing team scores the first goal, the penalty\ntime elapses for the player who entered the penalty area first, that player will\nbe released. If following the release of the player who entered the penalty area\nfirst, the opposing team scores, the player who entered the penalty area second\nwill be released.\nTwo players from same team, non-releasable yellow card followed\nby a releasable yellow card: A player receiving a non-releasable yellow card\nwill not be released if a goal scores; however, the carded player’s teammate who\nreceived the releasable yellow card will be released unless it is the team’s fourth\nor subsequent yellow card.\nOne player, two releasable yellow cards on same play: If one player\nreceives two yellow cards during the same play/stoppage of play, they will\nserve consecutive two-minute penalties in the penalty area. Penalty No. 1 will\nbe over after two minutes, or if the opposing team scores during the penalty\ntime, unless penalty No. 1 is the team’s fourth or subsequent yellow card. The\nsecond penalty will begin once the original time is over, either because the full\ntwo minutes has expired or because the opposing team has scored a goal. If\nthe opposing team scores a goal during the second penalty, the penalty will be\nreleased unless the second penalty is the team’s fourth or subsequent yellow\ncard; however, the player who received two yellow cards is not permitted to\nre-enter the game. The team may substitute another player for the player who\nhas been suspended.\nRed card, then releasable yellow card to players on same team: A\nplayer receiving a red card will not be released if a goal scores, nor will any\nother player from the red-carded player’s team be released if multiple players\nare in the penalty area unless the red-carded player’s teammates are serving\ngreen card penalties. If another goal is scored then the teammate who received\nthe yellow card may be released, unless the yellow card is the team’s fourth or\nsubsequent yellow card; regardless, the player who received the red card will\nremain in the penalty area to finish the five-minute penalty.\nRed card or second yellow card to one player: A player receiving a red\ncard or a second yellow card must enter the penalty area to serve the two-\nminute (yellow card) or five-minute (red card) penalty. The player who receives\nthe red card will serve the full five minutes. The player who receives a second\nyellow card will be released if the opposing team scores unless the yellow card\nis the team’s fourth or subsequent yellow card.

An official may observe the\nfollowing behaviors by a student-athlete with a suspected concussion:\n• Appears dazed or stunned.\n• Appears confused or incoherent.\n• Shakes head.\n• Stumbles; has to be physically supported by teammates.\n• Moves clumsily or awkwardly.\n• Shows behavior or personality changes.\nStudent-athletes with a suspected concussion must be removed from competition\nso that a medical examination can be conducted by the primary athletics\nhealthcare provider (i.e., athletic trainer or team physician).\nImportantly, a game official is not expected to evaluate a student-athlete.\nInstead, if an official notices any behavior that suggests a concussion, the official\nshould stop play immediately and call an injury timeout so that an appropriate\nmedical examination can be conducted. A simple guide to the official’s role is:\n“When in doubt, call an injury timeout.”\nA student-athlete who exhibits signs, symptoms or behaviors consistent with a\nconcussion, must be removed from practice or competition and may not return\nto sport activity on that day. The athlete must undergo medical evaluation and\nfollow a return-to-learn/return-to-sport protocol under the supervision of the\nteam physician, and may not return to sport until cleared by an appropriate\nhealth care professional. Sports have injury timeouts and player substitutions so\nthat student-athletes can receive appropriate medical evaluation.\nIF A CONCUSSION IS SUSPECTED:\n1. Remove the student-athlete from play. Look for the signs and symptoms\nof concussion if the student-athlete has experienced a blow to the head. Do\nnot allow the student-athlete to just “shake it off.” Each student-athlete will\nrespond to concussions differently.\n102\n\n[PAGE 108]",

An NCAA member institution will have\nthe right to seek, on behalf of any student-athlete with a disability participating\non the member’s team, a reasonable modification or accommodation of a\nplaying rule, provided that the modification or accommodation would not:\n1. Compromise the safety of, or increase the risk of injury to, the student-\nathlete with a disability or any other student-athlete;\n2. Change an essential element that would fundamentally alter the nature of\nthe game; or\n3. Provide the student-athlete an unfair advantage over the other competitors.\nTo request any such modification or accommodation, the member’s director of\nathletics, or their designee, must submit a rule waiver request, in writing, to the\nsecretary-rules editor. Such written request should describe:\na. The playing rule from which relief is sought;\nb. The nature of the proposed modification or accommodation;\nc. The nature of the student-athlete’s disability and basis for modification or\naccommodation; and\nd. The proposed duration of the requested modification or accommodation.\nAdditionally, each request should be accompanied by documentation evidencing\nthe student-athlete’s disability (e.g., a medical professional’s letter). Upon receipt of\na complete waiver request, the secretary-rules editor will consult with NCAA staff,\nthe applicable sport/rules committee, other sport governing bodies, and/or outside\nexperts, to conduct an individual inquiry as to whether the requested modification\nor accommodation can be made. In making this assessment, the NCAA may\nrequest additional information from the member institution. The secretary-rules\neditor will communicate the decision in writing (which may be via email) to the\nrequesting member institution. If the request is granted, the member institution\nshould be prepared to provide the written decision to the officiating staff, opposing\ncoach(es), and tournament director (if applicable) for each competition in which\nthe student-athlete will participate. NCAA members are directed to consult\nGuideline 2P of the NCAA Sports Medicine Handbook for further considerations\nregarding participation by student-athletes with impairment.\n104\n\n[PAGE 110]\nIndex to Rules\nTerm Page Term Page\nA Goal circle\nAlternate possession .....................................45 dimensions .....................................................14\nfouls ................................................................66\nB Goalkeeper\nBaiting, taunting .............................................68 equipment .......................................................23\nBall grounded ........................................................79\ndescribed ........................................................23 helmet requirements ......................................23\nlodged in clothing, crosse ..............................49 Green card ..............................................65, 79\nBenches -

Anytime the ball hits\nthe rim and the offense retains possession in its backcourt, the shot clock will\nreset to 30 seconds.\nLegal guarding position - (Rule 4-17.4.d) Established legal guarding position\non an airborne player with the ball, the defender must establish legal guarding\nposition before the opponent places the last foot on the floor prior to becoming\nairborne.\nCoach requested reviews - (Rule 5-14.1) Required when a coach requests an\nout of bounds play to be reviewed under two minutes in the second period and\nin the last two minutes of any extra period, that team will be charged a timeout\nif the original call is not overturned.\nTimeout - (Rule 5-14.1.a) Allowed a timeout to be granted when a player has\npossession of the ball even though the player is airborne.\nFlagrant 1 fouls - (Rule 4-12.1) Established that if a player commits three\nFlagrant 1 fouls in a game, the player would be disqualified.\nLive/preloaded video - (Rule 10-4.2.c) Permitted the transmission of live and\npreloaded video to the bench area for coaching purposes.\nPeacekeeper - (Rule 10-4.2.j) Permitted all non-student bench personnel to\nleave the bench area to assist in preventing a potential fight/altercation.\nGoaltending/basket interference - (Rule 11-2.1.b.6) Allowed officials the\nopportunity to review goaltending/basket interference calls during the next\nmedia timeout to ensure the call was accurate so long as the official makes the\ngoaltending/basket interference call on the floor.\nFouls as a result of flagrant acts - (Rule 11-2.1.d.3) Established that if a player\nis called for a foul, and upon Instant Replay the officials see that the foul is a\ndirect result of a Flagrant 1 or Flagrant 2 foul committed against the player\nwho was originally assessed a foul, officials may remove the original foul on the\nplayer who was flagrantly fouled.\n5\n\n[PAGE 9]\nMajor Officiating Concerns\nThe NCAA Men’s Basketball Rules Committee issued the following directives\nto the men’s basketball officiating community for the 2023-24 season.\nAdditional focus/attention should be given to:\n1. Post play - Call the first displacement foul especially on back down plays.\nDiscern between illegal and incidental contact. When a player dislodges\nan opponent from a legally established position, it is a foul.\n2. The consistent enforcement of bench decorum, the coaching box and\nunsporting conduct rules for both players and bench personnel.\n3. Coverage and whistle discipline - The consistent and proper\nimplementation of the three-person mechanics system leads to trust and\nincreased call accuracy as a crew. Our call accuracy decreases when we call\nplays outside our primary coverage area.\n4. Traveling - Identify the pivot foot when a player gains control of the ball.\nWhen players are allowed to travel, they gain a distinct advantage over\ntheir defenders.\n5. Clock awareness - Observe the game clock and shot clock throughout\neach possession. Obtain the magic number from each position on every\npossession.\n6. Freedom of movement - Our game is one of movement, screening action\nand cutters. Be diligent in calling fouls that inhibit players ability to move\nfreely around the court with or without the basketball.\n7. Enforce the rules.\n6\n\n[PAGE 10]\nSignificant Editorial\nChanges\nNote: These are additions/clarifications that have been part of interpretations or\ncustom but have not appeared in the rules book.

Sportsmanship is a key part of that goal. Sportsmanship should\nbe a core value in behavior of players and bench personnel, in crowd control\nby game management and in the officials’ proper enforcement of the rules\ngoverning related actions.\nThe NCAA Men’s Basketball Rules have been designated as either\nadministrative rules or conduct rules. Typically, administrative rules are those\ndealing with preparation for the contest. The conduct rules are those that deal\ndirectly with the playing of the contest. Some administrative rules (as indicated)\nmay be altered by mutual consent of the competing institutions. Others (as\nindicated) are unalterable. No conduct rule may be changed by mutual consent.\nAll NCAA member institutions are required to conduct their intercollegiate\ncontests according to these rules.\nIn the Men’s Basketball Rules, the administrative rules that may be altered by\nmutual consent of the competing institutions are Rule 1, Sections 2, 3 and 20.\nThe administrative rules that may not be altered are Rule 1, Sections 4 through\n8, 15, 16 and 18; Rule 2, Section 1; and the free-throw lane diagram. All of\nthe other rules are conduct rules and may not be altered.\nThe rules are divided into articles for ease of reference. Equipment/\napparel rules that are of concern primarily to manufacturers are contained in\nthe front of this section. All court measurements are included on the expanded\ncourt diagram.\nThose desiring interpretations of rules or play situations are asked to send\nquestions via email.\nJeff O’Malley , Men’s Secretary-Rules Editor; omalley.sre@gmail.com.\nNote: Officials may find updates and interpretations at Refquest.com.\n8\n\n[PAGE 12]\nImportant Information\nfor Manufacturers of New\nEquipment and Apparel\nThe NCAA Men’s Basketball Rules Committee is responsible for formulating\nthe official playing rules for the sport. The committee is not responsible\nfor testing or approving playing equipment for use in intercollegiate men’s\nbasketball.\nEquipment manufacturers have undertaken the responsibility for the\ndevelopment of playing equipment that meets the s pecifications established\nfrom time to time by the committee. The NCAA urges manufacturers to\nwork with the various independent testing agencies to maximize the safety of\nproducts. Neither the NCAA nor the NCAA Men’s Basketball Rules Committee\ncertifies the safety of any basketball equipment. Only equipment that meets\nthe dimensions specified in the NCAA Men’s Basketball Rules shall be used\nin intercollegiate competition. Similarly, only uniforms that meet the rules\nspecifications shall be used.\nWhile the committee does not regulate the development of new equipment\nand does not set technical or scientific standards for testing equipment or the\napproval or disapproval of specific playing equipment, the committee may,\nfrom time to time, provide manufacturers with informal guidelines as to the\nequipment-performance levels it considers consistent with the integrity of the\ngame. The committee reserves the right to intercede in order to protect and\nmaintain that integrity.\nIn general, the rules addressing uniforms are intended to positively impact\nthe following needs:\nCOACHING - Identification of an opponent’s personnel when scouting on\nvideo and for in-game coaching strategy.\nOFFICIATING - Proper foul reporting, identification of disqualified player\nor players involved in an altercation.\nIMAGE - How players appear on television/fan appeal.\nThe NCAA Men’s Basketball Rules Committee suggests that manufacturers\nplanning innovative changes in basketball equipment submit the equipment to\nthe NCAA Men’s Basketball Rules Committee for review before production.\n9\n\n[PAGE 13]\nCourt and Equipment\n1. Playing Area. When possible, building plans should provide for a playing\ncourt with ideal measurements as stated in Rule 1-2 and listed on the court\ndiagram, ample out-of-bounds area and needed seating space for scorers,\ntimers and fans. A long playing court permits use of two crosswise courts for\npractice and informal games.\nIt is recommended that padding that meets current ASTM standards be\nused on walls and other facility features in or around the playing area that\na student-athlete might contact during play. Padding should be installed no\nmore than 4 inches from the floor up to 6 feet.\n2. Ceiling. The ceiling and anything hanging from it (other than the basket)\nshould be at least 25 feet above the playing court and higher if possible.\n3. Boundaries. The committee recommends that a belt 8 inches or more in\nwidth be used to mark the boundaries on all courts that have at least 10 feet\nof open space between the boundary lines and the seating. This plan is urged\nfor all new construction and for other similar courts when the boundaries are\nre-marked.\n4. Lighting. The court should be uniformly and adequately lighted. Lighting\nengineers should be placed in charge of this important factor when planning\nany new installations. For information on recommended specifications for\nlighting, contact the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America,\n120 Wall St., 17th Floor, New York, New York 10005; telephone 212-248-\n5000.\n5. Warning on Misuse of Portable Backstops. Manufacturers and\nadministrators should be aware of an “extreme-caution” warning relative\nto the misuse of portable backstops. A high degree of injury potential and\na severe liability problem exist when anyone is allowed to hang, sit or stand\non the basket ring or backboard. Administrators must see that this practice\nis prohibited or that the portable units are lowered at the completion of the\ngame because of the high risk of severe injury, even death. A recommended\nwarning or inscription such as “Danger - please do not get on the rim/\nbackboard” is desirable.\n6. Locking Backboard. It is recommended that a locking device/safety\narrester be used for ceiling and wall-mount backboard systems that are\nretracted by motor-pulley cable arrangements.\n7. Backboard Padding. It is recommended that the required padding for\nthe backboard be mounted on the backboard by adhesive or material such\nas Velcro or channel. The bottom and each side of the backboards shall be\npadded with a Poly High-Car vinyl-type material that meets the Bashor\nresilience test with a range of 20-30.\nA lavaliere-type microphone properly positioned in the crease of the\nbackboard padding or between padding and backboard is permitted since it\n10\n\n[PAGE 14]\nCourt and EquipmEnt 11\nis not located on the padding and does not interfere with a live ball or create\na safety hazard.\n8. Ring. The design of the ring and its construction should be such as\nto maximize player safety. A movable basket ring shall have rebound\ncharacteristics identical to those of a nonmovable ring. The pressure-release\nmechanism should maximize these characteristics, as well as protect both the\nring and backboard. Movable rings are required.\n9. Ring Testing. It is required for Division I and recommended for Divisions\nII and III that all competitive rings for men be tested for rebound/elasticity\nonce before the season and once before the postseason. It is recommended\nfurther, in all divisions, that basket ring loads be transferred to the support\nsystem by a single strut boom behind the backboard, or to the backboard\nframe. The pressure-release/elasticity mechanism on movable rings may\nbe field adjustable. When released, the ring shall not rotate more than 30\ndegrees below the original horizontal position. After release and with the load\nno longer applied, the ring shall return automatically and instantaneously to\nits original position.\n10. Marking the Court. When marking a court, manufacturers should start at\nthe center of the court rather than at either end.\n11. Timing Equipment. Divisions I, II and III schools shall have a game clock\nthat shows a 10th-of-a-second display when less than one minute remains in\na period.\nDivisions I, II and III schools shall have either a red light placed behind\neach backboard that is visible through the 24-inch-by-18-inch rectangle\nor LED lights around the backboard. The purpose of either is to indicate\nwhen player activity is terminated. If LED lights are used, they shall be\npositioned not more than 6 inches from the upper and lower edges of the\nbackboard and not more than 5 inches from the side of each backboard.\nWhen both lights are present, the LED lights shall take precedence, and the\nred light shall be disconnected. It is recommended that the game clock, red\nlight or LED lights be updated in their synchronization.\nIt is recommended that all men’s Division I arenas provide a timing\nmechanism that enables the officials to start and stop the game clock\nautomatically. It is permissible also to have LED lights at the scorers’ table\nwhich are synchronized with the red lights/LED lights on the backboards\nand game clocks.\nA pole attached to the shot clock that is used to mount a camera or a\ncamera attached to the shot clock is permissible when the shot clock is\nrecessed behind the backboard and does not interfere with a live ball, nor\ndoes it affect the visibility of the shot clock.\n\n[PAGE 15]\n12 Court and EquipmEnt\n2023 Court Diag\n\n[PAGE 16]\nCourt and EquipmEnt 13\n\n[PAGE 17]\n14 Court and EquipmEnt\nNCAA Basketball\nRestricted-Area Arc\nRestricted Area\nI\nBASELINE\n3\"\n6\n>---- -- - --6'--- - - -----i\n1\n\"\n15\n48\"\n(to inner edge)\nRESTRICTED\nAREA\n2 \" 48\" RADIUS\nThe width of this 48\" from center of ring\nline shall be 2\" to inner edge of line\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1.

Exception 2: When an official’s or\nscorer’s error occurs in reporting/recording a foul which results in a player\nbeing replaced, the player is not subject to this substitution restriction and may\nre-enter the game at the next opportunity to substitute and before the game\nclock has been properly started.)\n\n[PAGE 45]\n42 ruLE 3 / pLayErs and substitutEs\nk. A player who legally enters the game during a dead ball may leave the\ngame during that same dead-ball period without penalty.\nl. When three or more substitutes for the same team enter the game, an\nofficial may honor a request by the captain of the opposing team to aid it\nin locating the entering players.\nArt. 2. Free Throws\na. An entering player shall not replace a free-thrower. When the substitute\ndesires to replace a player who is to attempt a free throw, the substitute shall\nremain at the scorers’ table until the next opportunity to enter the game.\nb. During multiple free throws for personal fouls, a substitute may enter\nthe game only before the final attempt in the sequence, unless otherwise\nauthorized by the rules or after the final attempt has been successfully\nconverted.\n1. Substitutions during a timeout but before the warning horn are\npermissible before the first free-throw attempt.\nc. On free throws for technical or flagrant fouls, all substitutes are permitted\nto enter before the first attempt or after the final attempt unless otherwise\nrequired by rule. (See Rule 3-6.2.d.)\nd. When a player is required to be replaced, such as for disqualification,\ninjury or blood, or a lost, irritated or displaced contact lens:\n1. Before the administering of multiple free throws, all substitutes, who\nhad legally reported to the official scorer before the player who had to\nbe replaced, may enter the game; or\n2. When no free throws are awarded, all substitutes, who had legally\nreported to the official scorer before the player who had to be replaced,\nmay enter the game.\nArt. 3. Required Substitutions\na. A bleeding player is required to be substituted for if the issue cannot\nbe resolved within 20 seconds. However, a timeout may be requested\nand granted when this player desires to remain in the game. When the\ncondition is remedied within the granted timeout, the player is permitted\nto remain in the game.\nb. A player with blood on his uniform shall have the uniform evaluated by\nmedical personnel. When medical personnel determine that the blood\nhas not saturated the uniform, the player may immediately resume play\nwithout leaving the game. When medical personnel determine that the\nblood has saturated the uniform, the affected part of the uniform shall be\nchanged before the player is permitted to return.\nc. When substitutes have reported to the scorers’ table prior to any situation\nin which a player is required to be replaced, such as for disqualification,\ninjury or blood, or a lost, irritated or displaced contact lens, the substitutes\nare permitted to enter the game.\nd. An immediate substitute shall be required when the head coach or any\nother bench personnel is beckoned, and/or comes onto the playing\ncourt, to attend to a player(s) who has been injured, unless a timeout is\nrequested by and granted to his team in that dead-ball period.\n\n[PAGE 46]",

A player-control foul is a common foul committed\nby a player when he is in control of the ball or by an airborne shooter.\n2. Team-control foul. A team-control foul is a common foul that is\ncommitted by a player of a team that has team control.\n3. Loose-ball foul. A loose-ball foul is a common foul that is committed\nby a player when any of the conditions in Rule 4-24 occur. A loose-ball\nfoul on an offensive player is also a team-control foul.\nb. Double personal foul. A double personal foul occurs when two opponents\ncommit personal fouls against each other at approximately the same time.\nc. Flagrant personal fouls. Flagrant fouls are personal fouls that are deemed\nto be a more serious offense than a common foul. The penalty for a flagrant\n1 foul is two free throws and possession of the ball for a throw-in. The\npenalty for a flagrant 2 foul is two free throws, possession of the ball for a\nthrow-in, and ejection of the offending player.\n1. Flagrant 1 personal foul. A flagrant 1 personal foul is a personal\nfoul that is deemed excessive in nature (unwarranted or too much)\nand/or unnecessary (avoidable, uncalled for or not required by the\ncircumstances of the play), but is not based solely on the severity of the\nact. Examples include, but are not limited to:\na) Causing excessive or unnecessary contact with an opponent;\nb) Contact with an opponent that is not a legitimate attempt to play the\nball or player;\nc) Pushing or holding a player from behind to prevent a score.\nDepending on the severity of the contact and the potential for injury,\nthis type of foul could rise to the level of a flagrant 2 foul;\nd) Fouling a player clearly away from the ball who is not directly\ninvolved with the play, specifically designed to stop or keep the clock\nfrom starting;\ne) Contact with a player making a throw-in;\nf) Illegal contact caused by swinging of an elbow that is deemed\nexcessive or unnecessary but does not rise to the level of a flagrant 2\npersonal foul (See Rule 4-18.7);\ng) Illegal contact caused by a player hooking an opponent over or under\nthe arm and which may lead the official to believe the contact was\ncaused by the opponent. Depending on the nature of the contact, or\nthe result of the contact, this foul could be considered a flagrant 2\nfoul; and\nh) Contact with an opponent that is not the result of a normal\nbasketball play. “Normal basketball play” is defined as any activity by\na player, including incidental contact, which is generally accepted as\n\n[PAGE 52]",

Depending on the nature of the contact, or the result of\nthe contact, the foul also could be considered a flagrant 1 or common\npersonal foul;\nd) Any contact by the offending player to the groin area of an opponent\nwhich is not clearly accidental; and\ne) Any foul similar to the foul described in Rule 4-15.2.c.1.g in which\nthe contact, or the result of the contact, is not only excessive but also\nsevere or extreme.\nNote: The above acts represent examples of potential flagrant 2 fouls. Other acts\nmay also qualify, if they meet the criteria of being not only excessive but also\nsevere or extreme.\nd. Simultaneous personal foul.

Simultaneous technical foul. A simultaneous technical foul occurs when\neach team commits a technical foul at approximately the same time, but not\nby opponents against each other.\nArt. 4. False double foul. A false double foul occurs when there are fouls by\nboth teams, the second of which occurs before the game clock is started after it is\nstopped for the first.\nArt. 5. Multiple foul. A multiple foul occurs when two or more teammates\ncommit personal fouls against the same opponent at approximately the same time.\nArt. 6. False multiple foul.

          "content": "Concussions\nRevised April 2023\nSport-related concussion is a traumatic brain injury caused by a direct blow to\nthe head, neck or body resulting in an impulsive force being transmitted to the\nbrain that occurs in sports and exercise-related activities.\nGame officials are often in the best position to observe student-athletes after\nthey have had a blow to the head or body, and may be the first to notice the\nbehaviors that indicate a concussion may be present. An official may observe the\nfollowing behaviors by a student-athlete with a suspected concussion:\n• Appears dazed or stunned.\n• Appears confused or incoherent.\n• Shakes head.\n• Stumbles; has to be physically supported by teammates.\n• Moves clumsily or awkwardly.\n• Shows behavior or personality changes.\nStudent-athletes with a suspected concussion must be removed from competition\nso that a medical examination can be conducted by the primary athletics\nhealthcare provider (i.e., athletic trainer or team physician).\nImportantly, a game official is not expected to evaluate a student-athlete.\nInstead, if an official notices any behavior that suggests a concussion, the official\nshould stop play immediately and call an injury timeout so that an appropriate\nmedical examination can be conducted. A simple guide to the official’s role is:\n“When in doubt, call an injury timeout.”\nA student-athlete who exhibits signs, symptoms or behaviors consistent with a\nconcussion, must be removed from practice or competition and may not return\nto sport activity on that day. The athlete must undergo medical evaluation and\nfollow a return-to-learn/return-to-sport protocol under the supervision of the\nteam physician, and may not return to sport until cleared by an appropriate\nhealth care professional. Sports have injury timeouts and player substitutions so\nthat student-athletes can receive appropriate medical evaluation.\nIF A CONCUSSION IS SUSPECTED:\n1. Remove the student-athlete from play. Look for the signs and symptoms\nof concussion if the student-athlete has experienced a blow to the head. Do\nnot allow the student-athlete to just “shake it off.” Each student-athlete will\nrespond to concussions differently.\n123\n\n[PAGE 127]\n124 appEndix vi / ConCussions\n2. Ensure that the student-athlete is evaluated immediately by an\nappropriate health care professional. Do not try to judge the severity of the\ninjury. Call an injury timeout to ensure that the student-athlete is evaluated\nby one of the primary athletics healthcare providers.\n3. Allow the student-athlete to return to play only if the primary athletics\nhealthcare provider has determined that the student-athlete did not\nsuffer a concussion. Allow athletics medical staff to rely on their clinical\nskills and protocols in evaluating the student-athlete to establish the\nappropriate management.\nAdditional information and details regarding concussions can be found\nat ncaa.org/sport-science-institute.\n\n[PAGE 128]",

          "content": "Accommodations for\nStudent-Athletes\nwith Disabilities\nThe NCAA encourages participation by student-athletes with disabilities\n(physical or mental) in intercollegiate athletics and physical activities to the full\nextent of their interests and abilities. An NCAA member institution will have\nthe right to seek, on behalf of any student-athlete with a disability participating\non the member’s team, a reasonable modification or accommodation of a\nplaying rule, provided that the modification or accommodation would not:\n1. Compromise the safety of, or increase the risk of injury to, the student-\nathlete with a disability or any other student-athlete;\n2. Change an essential element that would fundamentally alter the nature of\nthe game; or\n3. Provide the student-athlete an unfair advantage over the other competitors.\nTo request any such modification or accommodation, the member’s director of\nathletics, or their designee, must submit a rule waiver request, in writing, to the\nsecretary-rules editor. Such written request should describe:\na. The playing rule from which relief is sought;\nb. The nature of the proposed modification or accommodation;\nc. The nature of the student-athlete’s disability and basis for modification or\naccommodation; and\nd. The proposed duration of the requested modification or accommodation.\nAdditionally, each request should be accompanied by documentation evidencing\nthe student-athlete’s disability (e.g., a medical professional’s letter). Upon receipt of\na complete waiver request, the secretary-rules editor will consult with NCAA staff,\nthe applicable sport/rules committee, other sport governing bodies, and/ or outside\nexperts, to conduct an individual inquiry as to whether the requested modification\nor accommodation can be made. In making this assessment, the NCAA may\nrequest additional information from the member institution. The secretary-rules\neditor will communicate the decision in writing (which may be via email) to the\nrequesting member institution. If the request is granted, the member institution\nshould be prepared to provide the written decision to the officiating staff, opposing\ncoach(es), and tournament director (if applicable) for each competition in which\nthe student-athlete will participate. NCAA members are directed to consult\nGuideline 2P of the NCAA Sports Medicine Handbook for further considerations\nregarding participation by student-athletes with impairment.\n125\n\n[PAGE 129]",

Look for the signs and symptoms\nof concussion if the student-athlete has experienced a blow to the head� Do\nnot allow the student-athlete to just “shake it off�” Each student-athlete will\nrespond to concussions differently�\n87\n\n[PAGE 91]\n88 APPENDIX C / CONCUSSIONS\n2� Ensure that the student-athlete is evaluated immediately by an appropriate\nhealth care professional. Do not try to judge the severity of the injury� Call\nan injury timeout to ensure that the student-athlete is evaluated by one of\nthe primary athletics healthcare providers�\n3� Allow the student-athlete to return to play only if the primary athletics\nhealthcare provider has determined that the student-athlete did not suffer\na concussion. Allow athletics medical staff to rely on their clinical skills\nand protocols in evaluating the student-athlete to establish the appropriate\nmanagement�\nAdditional information and details regarding concussions can be found\nat ncaa.org/sports/health-safety�\n\n[PAGE 92]",

participating\non the member’s team, a reasonable modification or accommodation of a\nplaying rule, provided that the modification or accommodation would not:\n1� Compromise the safety of, or increase the risk of injury to, the student-\nathlete with a disability or any other student-athlete;\n2� Change an essential element that would fundamentally alter the nature of\nthe game; or\n3� Provide the student-athlete an unfair advantage over the other competitors�\nTo request any such modification or accommodation, the member’s director of\nathletics, or their designee, must submit a rule waiver request, in writing, to the\nsecretary-rules editor� Such written request should describe:\na� The playing rule from which relief is sought;\nb� The nature of the proposed modification or

accommodation�\nAdditionally, each request should be accompanied by documentation evidencing\nthe student-athlete’s disability (e�g�, a medical professional’s letter)� Upon receipt of\na complete waiver request, the secretary-rules editor will consult with NCAA staff,\nthe applicable sport/rules committee, other sport governing bodies, and/ or outside\nexperts, to conduct an individual inquiry as to whether the requested modification\nor accommodation can be made� In making this assessment, the NCAA may\nrequest additional information from the member institution� The secretary-rules\neditor will communicate the decision in writing (which may be via email) to the\nrequesting member institution� If the request is granted, the member institution\nshould be prepared to provide the written decision to the officiating staff, opposing\ncoach(es), and tournament director (if applicable) for each competition in which\nthe student-athlete will participate� NCAA members are directed to

opposite the team bench or beyond the end line� They\nmust be at least 2 meters (6 feet, 6 inches) from the court, or farther if the\nfacility allows� During timeouts and between sets, cheerleaders and official team\nmascots may be on their team’s playing area or anywhere in the free zone on the\nfirst referee’s side of the court� Note: For NCAA championship play, cheerleaders\nand mascots may be instructed by the tournament committee to remain on one\nside of the court throughout a match. However, cheerleaders and mascots must\nnot interfere with the opponents at any time. Bands, public address announcers\nand computerized noisemakers should cease playing when the first referee’s\narm is extended in preparation to authorize the service (Signal 16, Official’s\nMechanics), and must refrain from performing while the ball is in play�\nCheerleaders may use nonelectronic megaphones in a nondisruptive manner�\nPublic-Address Announcer Guidelines\nThe public-address announcer represents an important role in the administration\nand conduct of a volleyball event� The announcer can promote good sportsmanship\nwhile increasing the fans’ interest and enjoyment�\n• Before the match, the announcer should:\n• Review crowd control procedures with the event management staff (these\nmay include notes regarding exits, seating, safety measures and first-aid\nstation)�\n• Coordinate with the visiting team’s sports information personnel or coach\nto note correct pronunciation of players’ names�\n• Precede the national anthem with language such as: “And now to honor\nAmerica, please rise and join us in singing the national anthem�”\n• Read a sportsmanship statement such as “The XYZ Conference encourages\nand promotes good sportsmanship by student-athletes, coaches and\n\n[PAGE 84]\nEVENT MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES 81\nspectators� We request your cooperation by supporting the participants\nand officials in a positive manner�” Many schools and conferences have a\nsportsmanship statement to be used for this purpose�\n• During the match, the announcer should do the following:\n• Identify the score and all substitutes�\n• Announce the team taking a timeout�\n• Identify athletes involved in significant play (i�e�, kills, aces, blocks) for\nboth teams�\n• Announce faults (i�e�, net fault) in a manner that is nonjudgmental toward\nopponents and referees�\n• If CRS is used, follow the NCAA provided script to announce an accepted\nchallenge and result�\n• Recognize exceptional plays by both teams when possible� Those comments\nshould include positive statements regarding the play and establish an\nenvironment of fair play and good sporting conduct for all players and fans�\nVisible Scoreboard Operator/Timer Guidelines\nThe visible scoreboard operator should be instructed on the use of the scoreboard\nequipment by the event management staff before the match� During the match,\nthe visible scoreboard operator responsibilities include:\n• Start a countdown on the visible clock one hour before match time� Timed\nsegments of the prematch warmup protocol should be timed sequentially, with\nno interruption if possible� The referees will whistle a warning 15 seconds\nbefore a team’s timed segment ends, and the scoreboard horn should indicate\nthe end of each segment� Official prematch protocol is detailed in Rule 9� Note:\nIf a team chooses to not use the court during one of the timed segments designated\nfor its warmup, the court remains vacant for that time.\n• Coordinate with the official scorer to ensure that the scoresheet and the visible\nscoreboard display the same score at all times�\n• In a match that is using media timeouts (See Rule 11�2�3), sound the horn\nwhen the first team has scored 15 points (eight points in the deciding set),\nunless a team has requested a timeout prior to that point�\n• Start the clock immediately when the referees signal a timeout�\n• Sound the scoreboard horn to indicate the end of timeouts when time expires\n(clock shows 0:00) or when the second referee instructs the scoreboard\noperator to sound the horn�\n• Time the intervals between sets� Start the clock when the first referee releases\nthe teams to their benches, except for the interval before the deciding set� That\ninterval begins after the deciding set coin toss is completed�\n• Sound the scoreboard horn to indicate the end of the interval between sets\nwhen time expires (clock shows 0:00)� Ensure that the horn does not sound\nif the referees are ready to start play before time expires�\n• If an extended intermission is being used, a horn will sound at the 3-minute\nmark between sets two and three, or when the court is cleared if the\nmodification in Rule 8�4�2�4�6 is being used�\nPrematch Procedures\n• The playing area will be set up and available at least one hour before the\nmatch� At least 60 minutes before match time, the home team should\ndesignate the team area it will occupy to start the match�\n\n[PAGE 85]\n82 EVENT MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES\n• Match administrators must ensure that any nonplaying area used for warmups\nis equitably available to both teams�\n• Once a team’s lineup has been submitted to the scorer, individual team\nlineups will not be disclosed to the opponent and should not be displayed\nor announced before both teams have submitted their lineup to the scorer\nand the lineups have been recorded� Lineups should not be announced or\ndisplayed in rotational order�\n• Before the match begins, the national anthem is played and players are\nintroduced� During the anthem and player introductions, the first referee\nand the line judge working on the first referee’s sideline will stand to the right\nof the first referee’s platform� The second referee and the line judge working\non the second referee’s sideline will stand to the right of the net pole on the\nsecond referee’s side� On both sides, the referees stand closest to the net pole�\nPlayer introductions can be limited to just the starting lineup, or all players\ncan be included� Below are the recommended introduction procedures; at\nleast 30 minutes before the match start time, match administration should\ncommunicate to both teams and the referees which option is being used so\nthat both teams use the same procedure:\n• Option No� 1: Players move from the team bench to the end line as\ntheir names are announced� The national anthem may be played before\nintroductions (while the teams are at their benches) or after introductions\n(while the players are on the end lines)�\n• Option No� 2: Players stand on the end lines of their respective courts�\nThe announcer introduces the visiting team first, followed by the\nhome team� The national anthem may be played before or after player\nintroductions�\nAfter introductions and the national anthem, the first referee whistles the team\nmembers to the center of the court� After shaking hands, non-starting players\nreturn to the bench� The second referee checks the lineups and rolls the game\nball to the first server, and play begins immediately� These procedures may be\nmodified for televised matches�\nProcedures Between Sets\n• The court must be clear of spectators between all sets of the match, except\nduring promotional activities�\n• If the extended intermission is used (Rule 8�4�2�3), it will occur between the\nsecond and third sets and last no longer than five minutes, including warmup\ntime� If an extended intermission is used, a horn will sound at the three-\nminute mark between sets two and three, unless the conference modifications\nto intermission is being used (Rule 8�4�2�3�6)� Each team is responsible for\nreturning at the proper time� The intermission shall include at least three\nminutes of warmup time on the competition court�\n• A promotional activity may take place in the playing area during the\nintermission between the second and third sets, or only on the home team’s\nside between other sets�\n• Teams may perform ball-handling drills in their own team area between sets�\nTeam members may not serve or hit balls over the net�\n• When possible, the host institution should provide updated statistics to each\ncoach between sets�\n\n[PAGE 86]",

because the result of the play would be an\nillegal back-row attack� RULING: The second referee is incorrect� As long as the\nTeam A setter met all the requirements for a potential illegal back-row attack the\nsecond referee can review the video to see which fault occurred first�\nSITUATION 15: The Team R coach wants to challenge that the Team S libero\nwas in the front zone while using an overhand finger pass to set the front row\nattacker� The second referee refuses to accept the challenge because the first\nreferee indicated the ball was below the height of the net when contacted by the\nattacker� RULING: The referees are correct� Teams cannot challenge the height\nor location of the ball�\nSITUATION 16: Team R has not used any challenges going into the fifth set�\nThe second referee notifies Team R that they have three challenges to use in the\nfifth set� RULING: The second referee is incorrect� Each team gets an additional\nchallenge in the fifth set not to exceed two total challenges�\n\n[PAGE 128]\nOfficial’s Mechanics\nSUMMARY OF CHANGES AND POINTS OF EMPHASIS IN\nOFFICIATING TECHNIQUES AND MECHANICS\n[Note: Comprehensive information on officiating techniques and mechanics for\nreferees, scorers and line judges, as well as case studies, rule interpretations and\nofficiating opportunities can be found on the NCAA Central Hub and in the PAVO\nVolleyball Officiating Manual: www.PAVO.org.]\n1� Officials’ Arrival Time� The referees should arrive at least one hour prior\nto the scheduled match time (some conference assignors may require the\nreferees to arrive earlier than one hour)� Referees shall be courtside at least\n40 minutes before match time (or earlier if required by the conference),\nwhich is when their jurisdiction begins� Line judges and scorers should be\ncourtside at least 30 minutes prior to match time�\n2 Indicating Net Fault for Player Number “0�” When a player wearing “0” commits\na net fault, the referees will form an open “0” with the appropriate hand�\n3� Ending Timeouts Early� The horn indicates the end of all timeouts� Except\nfor televised matches, if both teams are ready before the timer reaches\n“0:00,” the timeout will end with a horn� The second referee controls all\ntimeouts and must be sure that both teams are ready to return to play before\ninstructing the scoreboard operator to sound the horn� If the facility does\nnot have a horn, a whistle will end timeouts�\n4� Officials’ Exit Plan� The officials should discuss their exit plan during\nthe prematch briefing� This plan should be communicated to the event\nmanager� If there is an intermission between sets 2 and 3, the officials will\nuse the same exit plan unless the intermission meeting is in a different\nlocation than the locker room� The first referee does not walk across the\ncourt with the line judges at the start of the intermission�\n5� Intermission Warning� If an intermission is used between sets 2 and 3, the\nscoreboard operator will sound the horn at the 3-minute mark (or when the\ncourt is to be cleared per Rule 8�4�2�4)� If there is no horn, a whistle is not\nused as an alternative�\n6� Deciding Set Court Switch (Televised Match)� During a televised deciding\nset, if a timeout has not been called by either team, the referees will\nadminister the court switch at 8 points and then sound the horn for the\nmedia timeout� During the media timeout, both teams will be on the side\nof the net that they will use for the remainder of the set�\n7� Participant Behavior� The NCAA Women’s Volleyball Rules Committee\nvoiced a concern about bench behavior� The referees need to give more\nattention to inappropriate behavior by assessing individual warnings (yellow\ncards) in order to maintain bench and player decorum�\n125\n\n[PAGE 129]\n126 OFFICIAL’S MECHANICS\nDUTIES OF THE SCORER\n1� Carefully review the scoring procedures and responsibilities described in",
