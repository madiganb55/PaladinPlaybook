      <h2>Points of Emphasis</h2>
      
      <h3>PROTECTION OF DEFENSELESS PLAYERS / TARGETING</h3>
      <p>The NCAA Football Rules Committee continues to embrace the targeting rule in order to promote player safety, reduce head contact and eliminate specific targeting actions from the game. The language in 9-1-3 and 9-1-4 stipulates that no player shall target and make forcible contact to the head or neck area of a defenseless player or contact an opponent with the crown (top) of their helmet.</p>
      
      <h3>CONCUSSIONS</h3>
      <p>Coaches and medical personnel should exercise caution in the treatment of a student-athlete who exhibits signs of a concussion. When in question, officials will declare an injury timeout for any player exhibiting signs of a concussion. See Appendix C for detailed information.</p>
      
      <h3>PRE-SNAP ACTIONS FOR OFFENSE & DEFENSE/DISCONCERTING SIGNALS/OFFENSIVE ALIGNMENT</h3>
      <p>The intent of pre-snap rules is to define and govern what is allowed by the offense and defense. Updated language in Rule 7 makes it clear for Team A, that any movement that simulates action at the snap is a foul.</p>
      
      <h3>FEIGNING AN INJURY</h3>
      <p>With the advent of the up-tempo offenses, there is a growing trend of defensive players feigning an injury in an attempt to slow down or break the rhythm of the offense. For the 2025 season, a new rule was approved to address these tactics. If a player presents as injured after the ball is spotted by the officials, that team will be charged a team timeout or a delay of game penalty if all timeouts have been used.</p>
      
      <h3>UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT/TAUNTING</h3>
      <p>For the 2025 season, it will be a point of emphasis for officials to penalize any taunting action that is directed at an opponent. These actions are a bad look for the game and can lead to unnecessary confrontations between the teams and must be eliminated.</p>

      <h2>RULE 12: Instant Replay</h2>
      
      <h3>SECTION 1. PURPOSE AND PHILOSOPHY</h3>
      
      <h4>Purpose</h4>
      <p><span class="rule-number">ARTICLE 1</span> Instant replay is a process whereby video review is used to uphold or overturn certain on-field decisions made by game officials.</p>
      
      <h4>Philosophy</h4>
      <p><span class="rule-number">ARTICLE 2</span> The instant replay process operates under the fundamental assumption that the ruling on the field is correct. The replay official may overturn a ruling if and only if the video evidence convinces the replay official beyond all doubt that the ruling was incorrect.</p>
      
      <h3>SECTION 3. REVIEWABLE PLAYS</h3>

      <h2>Points of Emphasis</h2>
      
      <h3>PROTECTION OF DEFENSELESS PLAYERS / TARGETING</h3>
      <p>The NCAA Football Rules Committee continues to embrace the targeting rule in order to promote player safety, reduce head contact and eliminate specific targeting actions from the game. The language in 9-1-3 and 9-1-4 stipulates that no player shall target and make forcible contact to the head or neck area of a defenseless player or contact an opponent with the crown (top) of their helmet.</p>
      
      <h3>CONCUSSIONS</h3>
      <p>Coaches and medical personnel should exercise caution in the treatment of a student-athlete who exhibits signs of a concussion. When in question, officials will declare an injury timeout for any player exhibiting signs of a concussion. See Appendix C for detailed information.</p>
      
      <h3>PRE-SNAP ACTIONS FOR OFFENSE & DEFENSE/DISCONCERTING SIGNALS/OFFENSIVE ALIGNMENT</h3>
      <p>The intent of pre-snap rules is to define and govern what is allowed by the offense and defense. Updated language in Rule 7 makes it clear for Team A, that any movement that simulates action at the snap is a foul.</p>
      
      <h3>FEIGNING AN INJURY</h3>
      <p>With the advent of the up-tempo offenses, there is a growing trend of defensive players feigning an injury in an attempt to slow down or break the rhythm of the offense. For the 2025 season, a new rule was approved to address these tactics. If a player presents as injured after the ball is spotted by the officials, that team will be charged a team timeout or a delay of game penalty if all timeouts have been used.</p>
      
      <h3>UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT/TAUNTING</h3>
      <p>For the 2025 season, it will be a point of emphasis for officials to penalize any taunting action that is directed at an opponent. These actions are a bad look for the game and can lead to unnecessary confrontations between the teams and must be eliminated.</p>

      <h2>RULE 12: Instant Replay</h2>
      
      <h3>SECTION 1. PURPOSE AND PHILOSOPHY</h3>
      
      <h4>Purpose</h4>
      <p><span class="rule-number">ARTICLE 1</span> Instant replay is a process whereby video review is used to uphold or overturn certain on-field decisions made by game officials.</p>
      
      <h4>Philosophy</h4>
      <p><span class="rule-number">ARTICLE 2</span> The instant replay process operates under the fundamental assumption that the ruling on the field is correct. The replay official may overturn a ruling if and only if the video evidence convinces the replay official beyond all doubt that the ruling was incorrect.</p>
      
      <h3>SECTION 3. REVIEWABLE PLAYS</h3>
      
      <h4>Scoring Plays</h4>
      <p><span class="rule-number">ARTICLE 1</span> Reviewable plays involving a potential score include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A potential touchdown or safety</li>
        <li>Field goal attempts if and only if the ball is ruled below or above the crossbar or inside or outside the uprights when it is lower than the top of the uprights</li>
      </ul>
