                <h2>The Game Overview</h2>
                <p><strong>Softball</strong> is a game made up of two teams of 9-10 players. The visiting team starts on offense (batting), attempting to score runs by touching all bases including home plate. The home team starts on defense (fielding), attempting to prevent runs and get three outs per inning.</p>

                    <strong>üéØ Game Length:</strong> A regulation game consists of 7 innings unless extended due to a tie or shortened by the eight-run rule.

                <h2>Special Rules and Situations</h2>
                
                <h3>Infield Fly Rule</h3>
                <p>With runners on first and second or bases loaded, and less than two outs, if the batter hits a fair fly ball that can be caught by an infielder with ordinary effort, the batter is automatically out. Runners may advance at their own risk.</p>
                
                <h3>Obstruction</h3>
                <p>Occurs when a defensive player not in possession of the ball or not in the act of fielding impedes a runner's progress. The obstructed runner is awarded bases they would have reached.</p>
                
                <h3>Interference</h3>
                <p>When an offensive player, coach, or equipment denies a fielder a reasonable opportunity to make a play. The interfering player is typically called out.</p>
                
                <h3>Eight-Run Rule</h3>
                <p>A game is called if one team is ahead by eight or more runs after five complete innings (or 4¬Ω if the home team is ahead).</p>
                
                <h3>Tiebreaker Rule</h3>
                <p>If used, starting in extra innings (typically 10th), each team begins its turn at bat with the player scheduled to bat ninth placed on second base.</p>
